# Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455
Lab projects for ECE 455 Embedded Systems. These were built using Keil uVision IDE and tested on LPC 1768 machines. Below are the brief introductions of the labs with links to the lab reports and main files of interest.

Lab1: Implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) framework, and then use it to build a system simulating a household thermostat.

Report: https://github.com/HPS-1/Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455/blob/main/L1/Peisen%20Hu%20ECE455%20Lab1%20Report.pdf

Main file: https://github.com/HPS-1/Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455/blob/main/L1/L1/p1_main.c

Lab2: Implement an ABS and Airbag System using the FSM framework created in Lab1, and then do WCET analysis on it.

Report: https://github.com/HPS-1/Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455/blob/main/L2/L2/455L2Report.pdf

Main file: https://github.com/HPS-1/Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455/blob/main/L2/L2/p1_main.c

Lab3: Implement a Cyclic Executive Scheduler framework, and then use it to build a Turbofan Jet Engine Controller model.

Report: https://github.com/HPS-1/Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455/blob/main/L3/455L3REPORT_PEISENHU.pdf

Main file: https://github.com/HPS-1/Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455/blob/main/L3/L3/p1_main.c

Lab4: An assignment style lab focusing on embedded security, with emphasis on caveats relevant to buffer overflow.

Report: https://github.com/HPS-1/Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455/blob/main/Lab4(Assignment_Style)Report.pdf

Main file: N/A as this is an assignment style lab.
