# Embedded_Systems_Labs_ECE455
Lab projects for ECE 455 Embedded Systems. These were built using Keil uVision IDE and tested on LPC 1768 machines. Below are the brief introductions of the labs with links to the lab reports and main files of interest.

Lab1: Implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) framework, and then use it to build a system simulating a household thermostat.
